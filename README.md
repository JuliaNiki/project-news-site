# News Site

This project, made as an assignment for the second week for Technigo bootcamp, was about building a newspaper site. The main goal was to learn how to create responsive webpage for mobile, tablet and desktop and combine knowledge about grid and Flexbox layout.

## The problem

The challenge for me was rather to make responsive design, than the layout. I achieved the result I wanted by setting media queries, but if I had more time, I would also experiment with replacing images on different screens and add one more section after small news to implement a grid layout to try another way of styling a page.
